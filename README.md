# Availity Frontend Assessment Assignment 

1. The proudest single moment in my professional career was being sworn into the bar to practice law in Illinois. It was the culmination of years of intense study and effort, and having my friends and family there to celebrate with me was a moment that I will never forget. 

With that being said, I am continually grateful and proud that a few years after that accomplishment I was able to make the difficult decision to change careers, attend Dev Bootcamp, and become a developer. By 2016 I had already made a few half-hearted attempts to learn coding through part-time online courses or intro to programming books. I discovered that I did not have the time and energy to learn this stuff on my own while working long hours as an attorney. I would become extremely discouraged when reading about other self-taught programmers who were able to learn C or some other low-level language on their own as teenagers. It took a lot longer than I would usually like to admit for me to get over my own ego and realize that I was going to need to find a support system and instructors in order for me to go after this new career path. I have had many proud moments and accomplishments as a programmer since then but the decision to quit my legal career and enroll at Dev Bootcamp was one of the most important moments in my life.
